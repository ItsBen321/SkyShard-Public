# Patch 0.10.1
> Bugs and Fixes

## Bugs:
- Weapons could be played in Pacifist mode using random generation
- Playing a different mode after Pacifist could hide certain units from appearing
- Transmuting units could give buffs with Necromancer Hut and Styx' Well
- Rare crash when multi-selecting while unit is getting removed
- Units could overlap when dragging quickly *(this one is hard to replicate so let me know if you still see this happening!)*
- Crash when conceding during Hero select
- Combat Log would not display correctly when 2 units have the same Name and same value (triggers, damage etc...)
- Window settings were still a bit clunky

## Other:
- Pain Inverter now stops appearing in King of the Hill
- Shelter now correctly displays "Adjacent *Town* units"
- Tier 3 / 4 Ancient Encounters no longer appear during Pacifist runs (these didn't hold any units in that gamemode)
- Improvements to the Ambience system
