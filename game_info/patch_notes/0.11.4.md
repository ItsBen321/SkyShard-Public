# Patch 0.11.4
> Small patch with some balance changes and bug fixes.
## Units:
- **Well**: Buffed Health from +5 -> +8
- **Wardens Flame**: Nerfed Health from 625 -> 350 / Explosive from 25 % -> 10%
- **The Pillar**: Changed Health from 200 -> 400 / Health Buff from +50% -> +25%
  - *The biggest issue with Pillar + Wardens flame is how easily it scales out of control, especially with superchargers. Giving this the same treatment as previous strong combos: better baseline stats but less scaling potential, making it useful to pick up without support and limiting its ceiling.*
- **Bakery**: Buffed from triggering adjacent town once -> twice
- **Dig Site**: Nerfed Tier from 3 -> 4
- **Prismatic Mirror**: Nerfed Health from 600 -> 550
- **Scarecrow**: Nerfed Cooldown from 1.7s -> 2s
- **New art**:
  - **Cannon Keep**

## Bugs:
- Auris was called Ambrose in the library
- DPS was broken on the unit UI
- Library sorting after selecting filters would change initial relative positions (Basically: Ballista would normally be displayed before Spellbound Rocket in the library. But after selected a filter like Weapons, the Rocket would now display before the Ballista)
- Small and Tiny Bamboo were still Tier 2 instead of Tier 3 (like the main Bamboo)
- Clicking on the combat logs after clicking "Continue" would get the menu stuck on screen
- Transmute encounter would not spend 1 mana towards quests

## Other:
- Changed encounter appearance odds, mainly lowering Faction specific shops on tier 4 / 5
- Different highlight color on the Leaderboard for your name
