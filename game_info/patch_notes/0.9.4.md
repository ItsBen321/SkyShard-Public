# Patch 0.9.4
> A little bit of everything: Features, balance, bugs and system changes!

## Features:
- Tips: Random nuggets of wisdom that appear while playing your first couple runs. This is useful information or just general gameplay info that didn't easily fit in the tutorial. You can view them in the Library once unlocked.
- Resummoned units now appear visually different (like a ghost-version)

## Units:
- Latching Spore: Lifesteal change (check ***Other***)
- Glow Berries: Health Bonus from 5% to 3% and max cap of 30 Health
- Blacksmith: Health Bonus from 2% to 1%
- Velmir the Wizard is now conditional and only shows up after you buy a buffable explosive Weapon (Artillery Repeater, Homing Missiles, Spellbound Rocket)
- Town Hall: new art and is now a 3x3
- Schola: now buffs 3% of the base Health and Damage

## Bugs:
- Build history didn't always display the correct builds
- Loading games didn't work properly
- Hovering a weapon in combat now more accurately highlights its targets (wasn't updating in real-time before)
- Pierce Damage on friendly weapons could target wrong units
- Black Hole didn't resummon units

## Other:
- Encounters now show a little Mana icon instead of the word "Cost"
- The 3/4 cost Nature Shop XL and the 4 cost Structure Shop XL now only offer 3 items instead of 6 (again a unit-pool issue until we add more content)
- Lifesteal is no longer a % of Damage, but a flat number when the Weapon deals Damage
- The *Rarity* tag is now changed to *Tier*
- Units that are permanently destroyed no longer return their Enchantments
  - *We might return this as a feature, but you could farm a bunch of Enchantments very quickly with The Portal and Research Facility*
