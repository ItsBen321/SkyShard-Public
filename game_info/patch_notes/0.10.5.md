# Patch 0.10.5
> Some balance changes and lots of extra polish!

## Features:
- Pause menu and game ui now also have custom buttons and animations
- All stone buttons now have sound effects
- Some units are getting small animations, most of these are temporary placeholders and experiments (can be toggled off in the settings)
- Unrated now has soft matchmaking (it will prioritize opponents with a rating lower than yours or higher by 200)
  - *We have a lot of high rank people playing in unrated, this simply prevents most people that aren't high rated themselves of facing them, while high rated players can still face anyone. Unrated should be a place for casual and experimental play.*

## Units:
- Refractor is back! Now changes the Faction of all adjacent units to the Faction of the unit on the right
- Infinity Pool: Health from 80 to 140
- Myrria Cursebinder: is now Ancient instead of Magic
- Compound Knowledge: Cooldown from 3.5s to 5s and buff from 1 Damage to 0.5
- Corrupt Shaman: Health stealing from 5 to 3
- Entombed Terror: Damage from 140 to 100
- Atomic Clock: now increases Cooldowns by 0.3s instead of 0.2s
- Spirit Torch: Damage buff from 10% to 15%
- Ruby: Damage buff from 3 to 5
- Haunted Clocktower: is now Tier 2 instead of 4
- Towering Shadewood: now works on all adjacent units instead of just Nature units, is now Tier 3 instead of 2
- The Big Tree: Health from 550 to 350
- Town Hall: Damage buff from 1 to 0.5
- New art:
  - The Big Tree
  - Forest Spirit
  - Arborist
  - Mana Machina
  - Towering Shadewood
- New sound effects:
  - Assembolator
  - Chamaeleontis (changes based on its random Damage Type)
  - Magnus the Miniscule (changes based on target size)
  - Blighted Ballista
  - Piranha Plant
  - Spellbound Rocket
  - Stone Gorgon
  - Unstable Tesla Coil

## Bugs:
- Some lore text and synergy units were mixed up
- Tree was still buffing for +10 instead of +5
- Loading a game back in didn't always show encounters
- Rare crash when conceding the tutorial
- Dragging units while looking for opponent could cause issues (you can no longer do that)
- Dragging units while board is loading after combat could duplicate that unit
- Enemy/Shop units will now correctly swap "left" and "right" in their info text
- Multi-drag could in some cases overlap units (this seemed to only happen when spam-clicking a multi-select, especially on a lower framerate)
- Casino didn't trigger properly

## Other:
- All summons in combat now have a tiny delay between them instead of happening at the same time (Toy Store, Elder Dandelion) and happen last
- When closing the game window, it will check if you're in a valid spot to save instead of always conceding the game (Valid spots are during the encounter phase. To make sure, just press escape and check the menu)
- General duplication/cheating protection
  - *We're putting in more checks and failsafes in case exploitative bugs appear. Of course the goal is always to fix the root causes of these bugs, but this will be a nice preventative measure. Also people looking for ways to cheat will be stopped in their tracks. This is an ongoing process.*
