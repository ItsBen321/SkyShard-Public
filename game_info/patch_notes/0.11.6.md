# Patch 0.11.6
> Bugs and optimizations

## Features:
- Right-clicking the inventory button will reset its position
- Projectiles from weapons now have particle trails! These are temporary, let us know how you feel about them

## Bugs:
- Even when the inventory went invisible, you could not interact with what's beneath it
- Library would not display previous builds correctly (and break when you had too many)
- Resummons during combat wouldn't work if the space was previously occupied (Altar of Decima, Mini black hole ...)
- Right-clicking a shop to open up the library will now correctly select the filters (so you can uncheck them)
- Inventory would sometimes expand down instead of up after moving

## Other:
- Inventory can now only be moved when dragging the top "Inventory" title
- Island stats are now displayed in the bottom right corner instead of the center so it won't block the island anymore when zoomed in
