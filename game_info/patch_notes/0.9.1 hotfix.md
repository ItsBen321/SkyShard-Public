# Patch 0.9.1 Hotfix
> Some quick fixes and balance changes.

## Units:
> Piranha plant is finally good and playable, but there's 1 combo to rule them all. I'll try a few changes and see how that impacts that specific build without nerfing the units individually too much.
- Synthetic Leecher: Cooldown from 1s to 1.5s and damage to 75
- Glowberries: Now buffs your rightmost unit instead of Defense
  - *This is a pretty unique effect, and essentially the same as before since you usually put all your defense on the right. It just stops specific combos and focused targeting while keeping its purpose and utility.*

## Bugs:
- You could duplicate items
- You don't get a guaranteed Weapon shop when starting with 9 Mana
- Supercharger with Crystal Core didn't properly retrigger Azurite
- Solo adventures not working

## Other:
- Fatigue now starts firing extra random shots after 30 seconds
  - *You could still hit stalemates when both players have a Graveyard at 0.1s cooldown.*
- Camera now zooms in at the end of game
