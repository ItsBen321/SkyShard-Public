# Patch 0.11.5

> Lots of highly requested features and optimizations!

> As we're getting ready for steam next fest within a week, most of our time goes into getting the game as optimized as possible! We also finalized all the new units and enchantments for our early access launch that will follow shortly after (currently 170 total units!). Feel free to leave any feedback, thanks for playing our game and being part of this journey :)

## Features:
- Updated end-combat animations
- UI for zapzap in the tutorial / tips has been upgraded
- Right-click on shops will now open the library with those shop filters
- You can now drag and move the inventory around
- Easier matchmaking for players rated 300 or lower
- Extra buttons next to inventory:
	- Open the library
	- Zoom in / out of your island
	- Island info (displays tiles and stats, same as to pressing spacebar)
	- Open the game menu (same as pressing escape)

## Units:
- Chamaeleontis: Damage Class bonus from 0% -> 10%
- Replicator: Can no longer target Weapons
- Dynamo: Health from 10 -> 40

## Bugs:
- Inconsistent leaderboard rank icon sizing
- Added all start of combat and passive effects to the combat activation logs
- When in the library -> builds tab, clicking on the little arrow next to the patch now correctly shows the patch options
- The header tab for previous builds in the library is now sticky on top (doesn't scroll with your builds)
