# Patch 0.10.7
> Some reworks and features!

## Features:
- You can now select a random Hero and get a free tier 1 unit as bonus
- While holding spacebar during combat you can now see a combat / fatigue timer

## Units:
- New art:
  - Mana Jar
  - Corrupt Alchemist (previously named Corrupt Shaman)
  - Spell Factory
  - Taron the Enchanter

## Bugs:
- Portal could generate conditional units
- When checking extra info holding spacebar, the Start of Combat numbers would appear behind the Enchantments, making them not readable
- Units in the background of the main menu could overlap with different islands
- Not all online modes were disabled if you couldn't connect to steam or the server
- Shelters could not stack on 1 unit

## Other:
- Damage logs now more accurately show the damage Weapons deal
  - *The logs will no longer report overkill or missed Damage, and take into account enchantments and other passives*
- Lifesteal rework
  - *Lifesteal used to just be a flat number that heals a Weapon whenever it triggers. Now it's an extra damage number on top of your normal Damage, it will only steal the life once the projectile landed and will conform to the actual Damage you did.*
  - *Example 1: You have 10 damage and +10 lifesteal, you fire a projectile with a total of 20 Damage. The target takes the 20 Damage and the weapon heals for 10 from the lifesteal after impact.*
  - *Example 2: You have 10 damage and +10 lifesteal. The target has 80% damage reduction, so it receives 4 Damage total from this projectile. The weapon only heals for 4.*
  - *Example 3: You have 10 damage and 10 lifesteal again, but the target only has 1 Health. The projectile only deals 1 damage and the weapon heals for 1.*
