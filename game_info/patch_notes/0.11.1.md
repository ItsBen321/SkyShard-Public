## Units:
- New art:
  - Bee Keeper
- Enchant Weaver: Instead of gaining a random amount of Health for removing an enchantment, it now gains +10 Health and another +30 if it removes an enchantment

## Bugs:
- Library crashes
- Enchantment encounter overlapped slightly with the island
- Enemy rating in combat overlapped with unit UI
- Small colored box was visible when opponent is loading into combat
- Warden's Flame art didn't flip
- Weather Machine art was too small
- Library tabs were overlapping with the scroll bar
- Taskbar icon didn't always display
- Small wording issues on UI

## Other:
- Victory "green" color was too hard to read on the end screen
- Updated the game name to "SkyShard" instead of "Project SkyShard" on your pc (the Steam Demo page still has to update the name)
