# Patch 0.10.6
> Bugs and fixes!

## Heroes:
- Ambrose: full art!

## Units:
- Community Cauldron: art + animation
- Piranha Plant: art

## Bugs:
- Stockmoore's Warehouse could give some new/unavailable items
- Elder Dandelion and Toy Store could still spawn an overlapping unit
- Refractor could sometimes not find the unit on the right
- When looking for an opponent, it displayed the last opponents' name for a split second
- Closing the window while in main menu instead of pressing exit could cause issues with your saved game (this was caused by the new autosave feature in the latest patch)
- Mechanic would still highlight Solo units
- Units could teleport and overlap by hovering over them quickly and clicking (especially at lower framerates)
- You could take damage from an enemy unit that got destroyed in the final frame of the fight

## Other:
- Cleaned up the UI a bit
- Main menu islands now show more depth
- When a bug causes you to lose a game on round 1, you only lose -30 rating instead of the maximum
  - *There have been a few bugs that put people in situations where a new game they start makes them lose all their rating. This is simply a failsafe in case that would occur again in the future to minimize the loss, without incentivizing people to concede games on round 1.*
