# Patch 0.10.8
> Happy holidays!

## Features:
- In combat, units that give random enchantments (Research Facility, Taron the Enchanter, Post Office) will no longer give Weapon enchantments to non-weapons and cooldown enchantments to non-cooldown units.

## Units:
- Blighted Ballista: new art!
- Firestorm Shelter: new art!
- Atomic Clock: is now a Start of Combat effect (0.2s cooldown increase)
- Latchwood Spore: now adds 7 lifesteal instead of 10
- Tesla Coil: no longer gets triple Health gain from lifesteal
- Big Red Button: now triggers 5 friendly Tinker units instead of 3
- Compound Knowledge: Cooldown is now 4s instead of 5s
- Ritualist: Could target non-Weapon units

## Heroes:
- Ambrose Protectors quest: Now needs 4 Defense units to complete, and rewards 1 Defense unit + 2 Jeffreys (instead of needing 2 Jeffreys and rewarding 1 Defense unit and 1 Jeffrey)

## Bugs:
- Rating could go below 0 in an edge-case
- Piranha plant would turn into a machine gun (counting its own lifesteal)
- Trees would not buff adjacent units after they were changed by Refractor to the Nature faction
- Ritualist could target non-Weapon units (like Magic Missile Mine)

## Other:
- Level Up Enchantment now scales infinitely instead of 10 times max, but gives 0.5 Damage on trigger instead of 1
