# Patch 0.10
> Custom game modes!

## Features:
- There are now multiple different online game modes (more solo content and tutorials are next)
  - Unrated: default gamemode without any matchmaking and ranks
  - Pacifist: no offensive units allowed
  - King of the Hill: 10 rounds with only 1 Hitpoint
  - Tiny Island: smaller island and less resources
- Ambience sounds
  - *There are now some Ambience sounds in the background, these get influenced by the Factions you're playing and how many units you have of that Faction*
- New steam store & library art!
- Ambrose: temporary art

## Units:
- Toy Store: New art!
- Cannon: New Sound!
- Big Laser Pointer: New Sound!
- Foundry: New art + name! (previously Industrialist)
- Homing Missiles: Explosive Damage from 50% to 20%
- Velmir the Wizard: Explosive Damage Buff from 2% to 1%
- New unit: Shelter

## Bugs:
- Screen settings didn't apply on startup
- Enchantments disappearing from inventory
- Units in inventory could carry over into next game
- EMP mine highlighting wrong units
- Rare crash when moving/selecting units too quickly
- Tooltip not disappearing
  - *Sometimes the tooltip sticks around when it shouldn't. I put a few extra checks in place but there might be more random events that cause this. Please let me know if/when/how this happens again*

## Other:
- New startup splash screen
- Tether 2000 can now take damage from Weapons that can't be buffed (but it still can't buff them)
- Added "Solo" Role filter to the Library
